            <h2>The Problem with Clinical Trials</h2>
            <h4> Finding the right clinical trial is frustrating <h4>
            <p> The medications developed clinical trials today are the therapies that have the potential to drive new treatments and potential cures over the next 5 to 10 years - from addressing the substantial unmet medical needs of diseases such as Diabetes and Autism, to rare diseases with no treatments such as ALS. The success of clinical trials are important to not only big stakeholders like pharmaceutical companies, researchers, physicians, but also to ordinary people like taxpayers and special interests. <a href="http://www.phrma.org/sites/default/files/pdf/biopharmaceutical-industry-sponsored-clinical-trials-impact-on-state-economies.pdf">Approximately $36.5 billion</a> is spent funding clinical trials every year, yet there lacks a functional query tool that makes the results and successes of these expenditures transparent. </p>

            
            <h4> Results are hardly ever published <h4>
            <p> Even with very specific tools such as <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</a>, 
            finding the right clinical trial can be extremely frustrating. Failures in clinical trials are hardly ever reported, with only 10% of studies ever published.
